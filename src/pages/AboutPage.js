        <h1> Under the Sun </h1>
        <h2>I developed this app as an antidote to my issue of constantly losing my "places to visit" lists in old journals and notes.</h2>
        
    <p> Instead of letting them sink into obscurity, I wanted a dedicated place to compile information about the places and destinations I'd like to see.</p>
    <p> Utilizing Google Maps API, the unofficial Atlas Obscura API, and my knowledge of React given to me by Ironhack, this app fulfills my needs:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Provides a place to list cities to visit</li>
    <li>Provides a way to list desinations to see in each added city</li>
    <li>Provides a way to update both cities and destinations once you've visited them</li>
</ul>

<h2>Many thanks to the entire Ironhack Remote Web Devlopment Class of June 2022</h2>
