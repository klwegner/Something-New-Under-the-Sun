        <h2>Under the Sun is an antidote to an issue all dreamers face: the scourge of constantly losing new "places to visit" lists in old journals and notes.</h2>
        
    <p> Instead of letting those lists sink into obscurity, user can compile information about the places and destinations they'd like to see here.</p>
    <p> Under the Sun utilizes the Google Maps API and the knowledge of React imparted to <a href='https://klwegner.github.io/kwegnerPortfolio/'>Kristen Wegner</a> by Ironhack. With that, this app:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Provides a place to list cities to visit</li>
    <li>Provides a way to list desinations to see in each added city</li>
    <li>Provides a way to update both cities and destinations once you've visited them</li>
</ul>

<h2>Many thanks to the entire Ironhack Remote Web Devlopment Class of June 2022</h2>
